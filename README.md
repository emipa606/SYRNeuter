Update of Syrchalis mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501449584

Removed the Neuter surgery as it was identical to the vanilla sterilization-surgery.
Made it more clear that the infertile-surgery is reversible.

- Surgery to permanently neuter animals, free
- Surgery to make animals reversibly infertile, 1 medicine
- Bill to abort pregnancy (works even on females in early stage)
- You can manually check each female for the "abort pregnancy" surgery to find out which are pregnant, this is deliberately this way to simulate "inspecting" them, to find early-stage pregnancies
